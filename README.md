This is a repository of the Python programs I developed while doing research at the University of Houston Clear Lake

CMP.py - this scans a simulation-generated dataset of all visible matter in an early universe, finds the 3-dimensional coordinate point in which the greatest matter density exists, and converts them to their relative coordinates
in the early universe, and prints it in the console


FrequencySeries3D.py - this scans a simulation of heat disparities in the cosmic microwave background based on several simulations with adjusted variables - it takes the dataset, concatenates it, converts the units to 
microkelvin squared, performs a fast fourier transform into 'wavelength', and prints it out using matplotlib in a graph format known as a "power spectrum". It can print graphs for each simulation dataset and display them
simultaneously for data analysis.

This code base is a solo development, and the main research came from the physics principles analyzed from the results of these Python algorithms
